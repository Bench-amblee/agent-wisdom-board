## Local backend & API keys

This project includes a small Express backend proxy that lets you keep API keys out of the client.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your real keys (do NOT commit `.env`).

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server:

```powershell
npm run server
```

Or start frontend + server concurrently:

```powershell
npm run start:dev
```

The server exposes proxy endpoints under `/api/openai`, `/api/linkup` and `/api/airia`. The frontend helper `src/api/backendClient.ts` shows how to call them.

Note on ports
--
By default this project expects the backend (FastAPI/Express) to run on port 8000 and the Vite frontend on port 8080. The Vite dev server is configured to proxy `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000` so you can call `/api/...` from the browser without CORS issues.

Start both locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
# In one terminal: start the backend (example for FastAPI)
uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal: start the frontend

npm run dev
```
